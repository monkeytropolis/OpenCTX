# OpenCTX_Main
Main branch for the OpenCTX control and imaging software.

This package is used to control the OpenCTX scanner. It includes all of the mechanical and electrical control logic, as well as detector driving and imaging routines.

This software is designed to run on a BeagleBone Black powered by Windows Embedded Compact 7. At this time, there is no support (planned or otherwise) for other platforms. Sorry.
